## Why POS Prime?

ERPNext's built-in POS is functional but limited. POS Prime is a complete replacement built from the ground up with Vue 3, designed for businesses that need a fast, reliable, and modern point of sale.

- **Fuzzy item search** with barcode scanning — typos, partial matches, and out-of-order words all work
- **Real-time stock validation** so you never sell what you don't have
- **Loyalty points** — redeem points at checkout with live balance deduction
- **Store credit** — automatically detects customer credit from returns/overpayments, apply at checkout with double-spend prevention
- **Partial payments & credit limits** — split pay, pay later, with automatic credit limit enforcement
- **Pricing rule discounts** — promo badges, strikethrough prices, discount labels, coupon codes, and free item rules
- **Resizable cart panel** — drag to resize the cart column, persisted across sessions
- **Self-checkout kiosk mode** for customer-facing touchscreens
- **Customer pole display** support (screen-based and VFD serial) with discount indicators
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (F1-F10) for lightning-fast checkout
- **Desk mode** — use POS inside Frappe Desk at `/app/pos-terminal` or standalone at `/pos-prime`
- **Quick customer creation** — create customers inline with dynamic form fields, no page navigation
- **Fullscreen toggle** — maximize/minimize POS with one click
- **i18n ready** — all UI strings wrapped for translation, RTL layout support
- **Works with ERPNext's inventory, taxes, and accounting** - no separate system

## Zero Modifications to ERPNext

POS Prime does **not** add custom fields, custom doctypes, or modify any existing ERPNext schema. It works entirely with ERPNext's standard doctypes:

- **POS Profile** - your existing POS configuration
- **POS Opening Entry** - standard shift management
- **POS Invoice** - native ERPNext invoices, fully compatible with consolidation and accounting
- **Item, Customer, Item Price, Bin** - reads directly from your existing data
- **Item Tax Template, Sales Taxes and Charges** - uses your existing tax setup

**Why this matters:**
- Upgrade ERPNext freely - POS Prime will never block or break your upgrades
- Uninstall cleanly - remove POS Prime and nothing changes in your ERPNext data
- No data lock-in - every invoice POS Prime creates is a standard POS Invoice, visible in Desk and reports
- Works alongside ERPNext's built-in POS - use both if you want

## POS Profile Field Coverage

POS Prime reads **38 of 40 meaningful fields** from the standard POS Profile doctype (95% coverage). The following fields are intentionally not used:

| Field | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `disabled` | Filtered at query level when listing available profiles; not needed at runtime |
| `country` | Read-only field auto-fetched from Company by Frappe; not directly consumed |

All 12 layout fields (Section Break, Column Break) are structural and only relevant to the Desk form UI.
